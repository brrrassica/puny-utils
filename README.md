# 🛠️ Puny Utils

Yo! Welcome to my stash of handy dev tools and scripts! This repo is where I dump all those sweet little utilities that make life easier when you're in the trenches.

## 🔥 What's in the Box?

As it says on the tin, this repo contains small utility programs for doing random stuff
- Python 🐍 
- Bash 💻 
- Whatever else gets the job done! 🚀

## 🎯 Features

Got some puny little stuff in here like:
- Log file splitter that chops up ginormous log files
- JSON to CSV converter for when your data needs a glow-up
- File cleanup scripts to nuke those old logs taking up space
- Plus whatever other cool tools I cook up along the way!

## 💪 Usage

Each script has its own usage instructions - dive into the folders and check out the comments.


## 📝 License

Feel free to use these scripts however you want - they're here to make your life easier! Just don't blame me if something breaks (but do let me know so we can fix it) 😉
